# Summary

EAM QuickView 1.0 is a browser-based application providing overviews of the geographical distribution of quantities simulated by the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Atmosphere Model (EAM) directly from the NetCDF files generated by numerical simulations. Compared to existing NetCDF file visualizers, EAM QuickView 1.0 supports the visualization of multiple quantities, arrangement of different figures by drag-and-drop, as well as saving the state of the visualization and resuming at a later time. Under the hood, EAM QuickView 1.0 uses the Python-based *trame* framework to create a simple and tailored user interface which provides access to the capabilities of the general-purpose data analysis and visualization application ParaView.

# Statement of need

EAM, like many other numerical models (simulation codes) used for climate and weather research and prediction, solves a complex set of differential equations and writes out results for a large number of physical quantities in the form of NetCDF files. After a simulation is completed and before more focused and detailed analyses are performed, it is often useful to conduct a quick inspection of the output files and obtain a first impression of the characteristic values and geographical distributions of the simulated quantities. The tool [ncview](https://cirrus.ucsd.edu/ncview/) developed by `@DavidWPierce:1993` has been used widely in the weather and climate modeling communities for quick and easy, push-button inspections of NetCDF files. The newer tool [ncvis](https://github.com/SEATStandards/ncvis) developed by `@PaulUllrich:2022` and released in 2022 is inspired by [ncview](https://cirrus.ucsd.edu/ncview/) but can also handle data on unstructured meshes. The EAM QuickView application presented here has the additional feature of visualizing multiple variables in a NetCDF file simultaneously. The model developers' wish for such a feature has become more and more prominent in the past years due to the rapid increase of model complexity in terms of the number of equations solved by the numerical models and the number of prognostic and diagnostic variables typically archived in the NetCDF files. For example, to inspect the simulated aerosol life cycles, it may be useful to visualize the concentrations of multiple chemical species in various particle size ranges (see, e.g., Fig. \autoref{fig:EAMv2}); to obtain an impression of the simulated clouds, it may be useful to show the liquid and ice cloud fractions as well as the mass and number concentrations of liquid cloud drops, ice crystals, rain drops and snow flakes in the same viewport, to allow for a quick eye-ball comparison or a visual inspection of potential relationships.
