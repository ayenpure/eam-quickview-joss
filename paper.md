# Summary

EAM QuickView 1.0 is a browser-based application providing overviews of the geographical distribution of quantities simulated by a numerical atmospheric model, the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Atmosphere Model (EAM), directly from the NetCDF files generated by numerical simulations. Compared to existing NetCDF file visualizers, EAM QuickView 1.0 supports the visualization of multiple quantities and the arrangement of different figures by drag-and-drop, as well as saving the state of the visualization and resuming at a later time. Under the hood, EAM QuickView 1.0 uses the Python-based *trame* framework to create a simple and tailored user interface to access the capabilities of the general-purpose data analysis and visualization application ParaView.

# Statement of need

EAM, like many other numerical models (i.e., simulation codes) used for climate and weather research and prediction, solves a complex set of differential equations and writes out results for a large number of physical quantities in the form of NetCDF files. After a simulation is completed and before more focused and detailed analyses are performed, it is often useful to conduct a quick inspection of the output files and obtain a first impression of the characteristic values and geographical distributions of the simulated quantities. The tool [ncview](https://cirrus.ucsd.edu/ncview/) developed by `@DavidWPierce:1993` has been used widely in the weather and climate modeling communities for quick and easy, push-button inspections of NetCDF files. The newer tool [ncvis](https://github.com/SEATStandards/ncvis) developed by `@PaulUllrich:2022` is inspired by [ncview](https://cirrus.ucsd.edu/ncview/) but can also handle data on unstructured meshes. The EAM QuickView application presented here has the additional feature of simultaneously visualizing multiple variables from the data file. The model developers' wish for such a feature has become more prominent in the past years due to the rapid increase of model complexity in terms of the number of equations solved by the numerical models and the number of prognostic and diagnostic variables typically archived in the NetCDF files. For example, to inspect the simulated aerosol life cycles, it may be useful to examine the concentrations of multiple chemical species in various particle size ranges (see, e.g., Fig. \autoref{fig:EAMv2}); to obtain an impression of the simulated clouds, it may be useful to inspect the liquid and ice cloud fractions as well as the mass and number concentrations of liquid cloud drops, ice crystals, rain drops and snow flakes in the same viewport, to allow for a quick eye-ball comparison or a visual inspection of potential relationships.

# Overall strategy

The creation of EAM QuickView was part of a bigger effort on more effectively leveraging modern visual analytics tools to facilitate the development of EAM. The general-purpose visualization application ParaView was chosen to be the engine in this effort because of ParaView's large collection of analysis and visualization capabilities as well as the ability to accommodate high resolutions and large volumes of EAM data through parallel processing. ParaView's own Graphical User Interfact (GUI) is comprehensive, but it requires a very steep learning curve for users unfamiliar with the visual analytics terminology, and hence has led to many cases of frustration followed by abandonment of the tool. To address this barrier, our strategy is to create a set of small applications with highly limited but tailored scopes, using GUIs presented to EAM developers in the language of their scientific domain. With EAM QuickView being the first member of this small-app family, other planned examples include quick comparison of two simulations as well as easy slice and dice of 3D fields using arbitrary planes and boxes. Since the development is focused on the EAM model at the moment, EAM QuickView is designed to work with the cubed sphere horizontal mesh and the pressure-based terrain following vertical coordinate. In this sense, EAM QuickView is an application written specifically for EAM, while the earlier tool [ncvis](https://github.com/SEATStandards/ncvis) can be used for models based on many different meshes. We do note, however, that our app can be adapted for other meshes by updating the ParaView Reader in the app.
